📖 The Story Behind It
Sometimes, the hardest part of movie night isn't picking the movie—it’s choosing dinner! Deacon, a character from our bedtime stories, now runs his own diner to help solve that problem. This little project was whipped up in a single night to bring some laughs, surprise, and simplicity to our evenings together.
